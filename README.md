3rd room / Greenhouse room

Welcome to the Greenhouse.

The door groans shut behind you, sealing you inside. The air is thick—humid, heavy, alive. Grass cushions your footsteps, and flowers bloom all around you: lilies, sunflowers, roses—vibrant, perfect, almost too perfect. A stone fountain stands in the center, its water trickling in an unnatural rhythm. Near the far wall, a small pond glistens, koi fish circling lazily beneath the surface.

But something is wrong.

The flowers do not sway. The leaves do not rustle. The air is still, too still, as if the entire room is watching.

Then, from beneath the lilies, something stirs. A whisper? A breath? Or just your imagination?

You’ve seen a lily before, haven’t you? In another room. A sign? A clue?

Go ahead. Dig. See what lies beneath. Maybe then, you’ll find your way out.

You think???

The room is filled with grass and flowers, with a stone fountain in the middle of the room. Most notably there are a patch of lilies, a patch of sunflowers, and a gorgeous array of roses throughout the room. There also is a small pond with koi fish in it.

Make the character dig up the patch of lilies (have a picture of a lily or a pot with lilies in it in one of the previous rooms). After digging up the patch, there seems to be a chest hidden underneath. The chest will contain a fishing pole with a magnet at the end of the rope. This item is to then be used to magnet fish the key to the next room.

4th Room

The Hall of Portraits

The moment you step inside, the air turns cold. The door slams shut behind you, sealing you in darkness—except for the flickering glow of candle sconces lining the walls.

The room is long and narrow, filled with portraits. Rows upon rows of old, painted faces stare down at you. Some are noble, some are common, but all have one thing in common—their eyes seem to follow your every move.

At the far end of the hallway, a single door stands, locked tight. A gold plaque beside it reads:

"Only the one who does not belong shall set you free."

As you take a step forward, the candlelight flickers wildly, and a whisper snakes through the air:

"They are watching."

The 10 Portraits:

The Noblewoman (1682) – A woman in an extravagant Victorian dress, her gloved hand resting on a cane.

The Soldier (1805) – A young man in a red military coat, saber at his hip, a battlefield behind him.

The Twins (1901) – Two eerie-looking girls in white lace dresses, standing hand in hand.

The Scholar (1750) – An elderly man with round glasses and a quill, an open book on his lap.

The Widow (1857) – A woman in mourning black, her veil covering most of her face.

The Merchant (1603) – A rotund man with a feathered hat, holding a bag of gold.

The Jester (1400s) – A man in colorful clothes and a painted mask, frozen mid-laugh.

The Farmer (1720) – A bearded man in dirty overalls, holding a pitchfork.

The Duchess (1660) – A regal woman wearing an elaborate pearl necklace, staring blankly.

The Stranger (Unknown Date) – A pale figure, barely visible in the shadows, with an obscured face

5th Room The Marionette Theater

As you step inside, the door locks behind you with a loud clunk. The room is dim, lit only by flickering candle sconces along the crimson velvet walls. A dusty wooden stage stands before you, its curtains slightly parted.

Rows of empty seats stretch toward the stage, their backs carved with strange symbols. High above, wooden marionettes dangle from strings, motionless—at first.

Then, with a slow, mechanical creak… one puppet turns its head toward you.

From the shadows, a hollow voice echoes through the room:

"The show must go on."

Bonus Challenge

If you got 7 or more correct, the marionettes allow you to leave. If not… well, let's just say they have other plans for you.

6th room – // A room that is spinning around causing the player to feel disoriented and impedes his movements and attempts of actions. The door to the next room is visible and open but because the player is dizzy from the spinning he falls over during every attempt to leave. To eventually leave the room the player must find a way for the room to stop spinning. (Just an outline for now, thinking of making the room be carousal themed with the actual room spinning or it being drug induced. Depending on what we decide is how we’ll set up the escape plan). //
|
7th room: A mirror maze room where the player must find a specific path to escape to the next room. Include false exits that shatter when the player walks through them damaging him (would need to add a health system for the player, can do hit points and then once the player walks through a certain number of false doors he dies).

Due to this room being a maze, we can have this room be the only one in the game that doesn’t include a timer.

Could also include certain traps that if the player walks into, they die or they get sent back to the beginning part of the maze.

8th room option: A room with a safe in the corner with a combination of 5 digits. A crack in the ceiling reveals a ray of light shining down into the center of the room where a rotating device neatly sits. The device looks like it is missing something.

The walls are also covered in numbers written in blood, too many to decipher the combination for the safe at first glance.

-8th room: “boss” room with the minotaur. We allow the player to fight with a sword if he finds it somewhere in a certain previous room or just his fists. Have it to where the minotaur one shots you or be super difficult. The only way or the best way to get past the minotaur is by acquiring the red blanket reign gives you and wearing it. Have her tip being that she used to cover herself up with it when she’d get scared or something along those lines. After adorning the red blanket, the minotaur is blind to the players movements allowing the player to sneak past and escape to the next room.

9th room: A graveyard containing the graves of the previous players of the escape room. Each ghost from the previous rooms has a headstone. The headstone details include which room each ghost died in. The goal of this room is to find the headstone that doesn’t belong and digging up the grave revealing a trap door that leads into either:

A control room where we find the man responsible and set up an actual boss fight (not the minotaur boss but someone else)

Or

A sewer system that leads outside of the building where the escape rooms are located.

* STARTER ROOM = Includes beginner items for the player and introduces you to the first character(John) who offers a simple explanation of the escape rooms. 

1st 0 =  John: 
Happy Birthday, dear friend...
You’re finally 21. A beautiful age — old enough to celebrate, young enough to make mistakes.
And perhaps... one of them was walking into this room.

Do you like cake?
There's one waiting just for you.
Candles flicker, time ticks, and the door... well, it’s locked.

Maybe... just maybe... if you blow out the candles, you’ll find your way out.
Or maybe you'll... stay here with me... forever. 

Instruction:

Blow out the candles to reveal a secret code.
You’ll need that code — in the correct order — to unlock the door.
If you choose not to blow them out... well, your time might run out faster than you think.


1st $ = Happy Birthday Room

Hidden Hint #1 = "Sometimes... the truth is revealed in reverse."

Hidden Hint #2 = “The numbers have always been right in front of you. Just turn them around.”

Happy Birthday. You are finally turning 21 years old. You know time really does fly ahead of us. I hope you like cake, maybe you should blow these candles out and make a wish maybe you can find your way out. You think???

2nd 0 Left:  

Ah... welcome to the Greenhouse.

A place where life thrives...
And yet, nothing here breathes.

The door slams shut behind you. The outside world fades.
The grass beneath you cushions your step.
The fountain trickles... not with rhythm, but with warning.

You notice them, don’t you?
The lilies… like the one you saw before.
That was no accident. This is no coincidence.

Something waits beneath.
Something meant to be found.

You are surrounded by:

A stone fountain in the center (strangely rhythmic dripping sound).

A patch of lilies (identical to the potted lily from a previous room).

Sunflowers and roses blooming in impossible perfection.

A small pond in the far corner, where koi fish drift lazily in slow circles.

The air is thick with silence.

2nd $ Left:

Player Action:
Do you want to dig up the patch of lilies?

[Yes]

[No]

If YES:
You kneel beside the lilies — they don't resist your touch.
As your hands dig into the dirt, the soil parts too easily.

Beneath the surface, something hard... cold... metal.

You uncover a chest.

Opening the Chest:
Inside lies an odd item: a fishing pole... but not for catching fish.

At the end of the line: a magnet.

John whispers:

Not everything in this room belongs to the earth... some things sink below.
And what sinks... must be drawn up.

Using the Fishing Pole:
Prompt the player to interact with the koi pond:

Use the magnetic fishing pole on the pond?

[Yes]

[No]

If YES:
You lower the magnet into the pond.
It glides past koi, past silt... and then — clink.

The pole jerks. You pull it up.

A rusted key clings to the magnet.

John murmurs:

It’s not the water that hides things... it’s the stillness.
Take the key. The door to the next room waits.

Hidden Environmental Clue (Ties Back):
In the Happy Birthday Room, the pot of lilies near the cake was purely aesthetic — but now, players realize it was a subtle foreshadowing: the lily motif is a breadcrumb trail.

2nd 0 Right: The Hall of Potraits 
Reign

Step lightly...

You’ve entered The Hall of Portraits — a place where time stands still...
…and the eyes of the past never stop watching.

As the door seals behind you, candlelight flickers to life, casting long shadows on the faces of ten painted souls.

Their eyes... follow.

At the far end of the hall, a locked door waits.
Beside it, a golden plaque reads:

"Only the one who does not belong shall set you free."

And then… the whisper comes again:

"They are watching."

2nd $ Right: 
The 10 Portraits:
The Noblewoman (1682) – Victorian dress, cane in hand.

The Soldier (1805) – Red military coat, battlefield backdrop.

The Twins (1901) – Eerie girls in lace, hand-in-hand.

The Scholar (1750) – Old man with glasses, reading.

The Widow (1857) – Mourning black, veiled face.

The Merchant (1603) – Feathered hat, holding gold.

The Jester (1400s) – Painted mask, frozen mid-laugh.

The Farmer (1720) – Bearded, pitchfork in hand.

The Duchess (1660) – Regal, pearl necklace.

The Stranger (Unknown Date) – Pale, obscured face, barely visible in shadow.

Reign whispers:

"Nine have their time… One does not belong."

Puzzle Prompt:
Which portrait does not belong?
(Type the name exactly: e.g., "The Jester")

 Attempts Left: 3

 Correct Answer: The Stranger
Why?

All other portraits have known dates, historical appearances, and recognizable societal roles.

The Stranger lacks a date, has no clear features, and doesn’t fit the time periods.

If user guesses wrong (e.g., "The Soldier"):
Reign hisses from the shadows...

"Wrong answer... 2 attempts remain. Choose carefully."

(Repeat for each wrong guess, decrementing attempts.)

If 3 Attempts Are Used:
Suddenly, every portrait’s mouth opens in a silent scream.

The candles extinguish all at once.

Game Over.

Restarting Hall of Portraits…

 If user chooses The Stranger:
 You speak the name aloud... and silence follows.

A click.
The locked door creaks open.

Reign whispers:

"Very good... you see through the lies of time. The Stranger was never one of us."
"Proceed — but know the eyes never truly stop watching."


3rd 0 Right: 

Ah... the stage.

Where lies are dressed as truth… and truth is forced to perform.

The door behind you locks with a sharp clunk. The velvet curtain falls still.
You are no longer the audience.

You are the act.

Rows of empty theater seats face the stage — too empty. Too quiet.
Above you… marionettes dangle on strings, heads bowed. Waiting.

One twitches. Another turns.

The strings remember you.
They know when you've lied. They know when you're afraid.

You are surrounded by:

A dusty stage with curtains slightly parted.

Velvet-covered walls and empty seats carved with strange runes.

Marionettes suspended from above — all wooden, all still… for now.

A faint, warped lullaby playing from nowhere and everywhere.

Then — a voice. Hollow, amused. Reign.

👻 “This is my favorite room, you know. The drama. The performance. The tension.”

👻 “And now it’s your turn to entertain…”

🎮 Player Challenge:

🕯️ Reign whispers:
"Answer me this... and the next... and the next."
"Ten questions. Seven must be right."
"You’re not just answering horror trivia. You’re answering to the strings."

👻 “Get seven correct — and the audience applauds. You leave… maybe.”
👻 “Fail... and the marionettes won’t need strings to move.”

🔎 Player Prompt:

🎬 Are you ready to begin the performance?

[Yes]
[No]

🪓 If YES:

The lights dim further. A spotlight flickers onto the stage. The marionettes twitch in unison.

Reign’s voice echoes from the rafters… louder now. Excited.

👻 “Let the curtain rise. Let the quiz begin.”

🧩 Hidden Thematic Thread (Ties Back):

In earlier rooms, subtle puppet and string imagery appeared — a cracked porcelain doll, a broken music box, a tangled thread hanging from the ceiling.
None of it made sense… until now.

They weren’t just decoration.

They were rehearsals.

4th 0 Left and Right:

Ah… the corridor with no end.
You’ve found it.

Or… perhaps it’s found you.

Welcome to The Endless Room — a place where time loops, and choices matter more than you think.

👻 Reign whispers softly behind your ear:

"Not every step is forward… some just bring you back to where you began."

🌒 Room Description:
You stand in a dimly lit hallway. The walls are damp, the ceiling too high to see. Shadows twist and stretch endlessly.

To your LEFT: A faint blue light flickers, almost as if it’s pulsing… breathing.

To your RIGHT: You hear a distant whisper — unintelligible, but unmistakably calling your name.

The hallway stretches in both directions, seemingly infinite.

4th $ left and right: 

🧭 Player Choice 1:
➡️ [Go Left]
You step toward the blue light. The air grows colder with every step. A chill brushes against your skin.

To your LEFT now: A wall covered in strange symbols, etched deep and glowing faintly.

To your RIGHT: A doorway, cracked open just enough to see blackness beyond.

👻 Reign hums behind you:

“You’ve seen these markings before… you just don’t remember when.”

🧭 Player Choice 2:
➡️ [Go Right]
You reach for the cracked door and push it open. It groans on rusted hinges.

🕳️ A gust of warm air greets you.

✨ You’ve escaped the hallway.

💀 Looping Path (If Wrong Choice Made Earlier)
If you go the wrong way at any point, the hallway resets — the beginning returns, but slightly… changed. A symbol moved. A whisper louder.

👻 Reign chuckles in the distance:

"Some paths aren’t meant to be followed. But followed they are, again and again…”


3rd 0 Left: 

Ah, words… such a delicate thing, aren’t they?

You’ve stepped into the Vanishing Phrase Room, where sentences lose their form and you must find what’s missing.

The room is dim, with letters floating in the air, fading in and out. Each time a phrase appears, it vanishes—only to return with something left behind.

👻 Bob’s voice echoes from the shadows:

“Let’s see if you can put the pieces together… I’m watching, of course.”

💭 Instructions:
In this room, phrases will appear, but vowels will be missing. Your task is to guess the missing vowels and complete the phrase.

👻 Bob whispers:

“Can you unlock the meaning, or will the silence claim you instead?”


BOSS GAME 0 : 

The atmosphere shifts as you enter The Shadowed Arena. The air grows heavier, the temperature colder. You're no longer in a safe space—this is where battles take place. A spectral figure materializes before you. Bob, your ghostly guide, has led you here, but this time, he’s staying out of it.

You hear a low, menacing growl. A shadowy creature lurks in the center, its glowing eyes locked onto you. Its body shifts like smoke, but its form is unmistakable—a boss.

👻 Bob’s voice echoes from the shadows:

“Ready to face the darkness? I wouldn’t recommend it, but you’re free to try.”


BOSS GAME $:


Boss Name: The Shadowed One

🕹️ Player Action:
In this battle, you have two main commands:

[Attack]

You can choose to attack the boss with your Punch or other available actions.

[Punch]

A quick, physical attack that deals moderate damage.

Combat Overview:
Health Bars:

Your Health: 100%

Boss Health: 100%

Your Turn:
The Shadowed One strikes first, claws reaching out like mist. You dodge just in time!

It’s your turn.

Options:

[Attack] — Unleash your next move!

[Punch] — You throw a quick punch at the creature’s shadowy form.

Example Round:
You choose [Punch]:
You rush forward, throwing a punch at the Shadowed One. Your fist connects, but it passes through the shadowy form like mist, leaving behind a small mark. The boss flinches slightly.

Shadowed One’s Response:
The creature retaliates, its claws swiping in your direction. It doesn’t hit, but you feel the icy air cut through you.

Bob’s commentary:

“It’s just a shadow, after all. But every shadow has its origin.”
