3rd room / Greenhouse room

Welcome to the Greenhouse.

The door groans shut behind you, sealing you inside. The air is thick—humid, heavy, alive. Grass cushions your footsteps, and flowers bloom all around you: lilies, sunflowers, roses—vibrant, perfect, almost too perfect. A stone fountain stands in the center, its water trickling in an unnatural rhythm. Near the far wall, a small pond glistens, koi fish circling lazily beneath the surface.

But something is wrong.

The flowers do not sway. The leaves do not rustle. The air is still, too still, as if the entire room is watching.

Then, from beneath the lilies, something stirs. A whisper? A breath? Or just your imagination?

You’ve seen a lily before, haven’t you? In another room. A sign? A clue?

Go ahead. Dig. See what lies beneath. Maybe then, you’ll find your way out.

You think???

The room is filled with grass and flowers, with a stone fountain in the middle of the room. Most notably there are a patch of lilies, a patch of sunflowers, and a gorgeous array of roses throughout the room. There also is a small pond with koi fish in it.

Make the character dig up the patch of lilies (have a picture of a lily or a pot with lilies in it in one of the previous rooms). After digging up the patch, there seems to be a chest hidden underneath. The chest will contain a fishing pole with a magnet at the end of the rope. This item is to then be used to magnet fish the key to the next room.

4th Room

The Hall of Portraits

The moment you step inside, the air turns cold. The door slams shut behind you, sealing you in darkness—except for the flickering glow of candle sconces lining the walls.

The room is long and narrow, filled with portraits. Rows upon rows of old, painted faces stare down at you. Some are noble, some are common, but all have one thing in common—their eyes seem to follow your every move.

At the far end of the hallway, a single door stands, locked tight. A gold plaque beside it reads:

"Only the one who does not belong shall set you free."

As you take a step forward, the candlelight flickers wildly, and a whisper snakes through the air:

"They are watching."

The 10 Portraits:

The Noblewoman (1682) – A woman in an extravagant Victorian dress, her gloved hand resting on a cane.

The Soldier (1805) – A young man in a red military coat, saber at his hip, a battlefield behind him.

The Twins (1901) – Two eerie-looking girls in white lace dresses, standing hand in hand.

The Scholar (1750) – An elderly man with round glasses and a quill, an open book on his lap.

The Widow (1857) – A woman in mourning black, her veil covering most of her face.

The Merchant (1603) – A rotund man with a feathered hat, holding a bag of gold.

The Jester (1400s) – A man in colorful clothes and a painted mask, frozen mid-laugh.

The Farmer (1720) – A bearded man in dirty overalls, holding a pitchfork.

The Duchess (1660) – A regal woman wearing an elaborate pearl necklace, staring blankly.

The Stranger (Unknown Date) – A pale figure, barely visible in the shadows, with an obscured face

5th Room The Marionette Theater

As you step inside, the door locks behind you with a loud clunk. The room is dim, lit only by flickering candle sconces along the crimson velvet walls. A dusty wooden stage stands before you, its curtains slightly parted.

Rows of empty seats stretch toward the stage, their backs carved with strange symbols. High above, wooden marionettes dangle from strings, motionless—at first.

Then, with a slow, mechanical creak… one puppet turns its head toward you.

From the shadows, a hollow voice echoes through the room:

"The show must go on."

Bonus Challenge

If you got 7 or more correct, the marionettes allow you to leave. If not… well, let's just say they have other plans for you.

6th room – // A room that is spinning around causing the player to feel disoriented and impedes his movements and attempts of actions. The door to the next room is visible and open but because the player is dizzy from the spinning he falls over during every attempt to leave. To eventually leave the room the player must find a way for the room to stop spinning. (Just an outline for now, thinking of making the room be carousal themed with the actual room spinning or it being drug induced. Depending on what we decide is how we’ll set up the escape plan). //
|
7th room: A mirror maze room where the player must find a specific path to escape to the next room. Include false exits that shatter when the player walks through them damaging him (would need to add a health system for the player, can do hit points and then once the player walks through a certain number of false doors he dies).

Due to this room being a maze, we can have this room be the only one in the game that doesn’t include a timer.

Could also include certain traps that if the player walks into, they die or they get sent back to the beginning part of the maze.

8th room option: A room with a safe in the corner with a combination of 5 digits. A crack in the ceiling reveals a ray of light shining down into the center of the room where a rotating device neatly sits. The device looks like it is missing something.

The walls are also covered in numbers written in blood, too many to decipher the combination for the safe at first glance.

-8th room: “boss” room with the minotaur. We allow the player to fight with a sword if he finds it somewhere in a certain previous room or just his fists. Have it to where the minotaur one shots you or be super difficult. The only way or the best way to get past the minotaur is by acquiring the red blanket reign gives you and wearing it. Have her tip being that she used to cover herself up with it when she’d get scared or something along those lines. After adorning the red blanket, the minotaur is blind to the players movements allowing the player to sneak past and escape to the next room.

9th room: A graveyard containing the graves of the previous players of the escape room. Each ghost from the previous rooms has a headstone. The headstone details include which room each ghost died in. The goal of this room is to find the headstone that doesn’t belong and digging up the grave revealing a trap door that leads into either:

A control room where we find the man responsible and set up an actual boss fight (not the minotaur boss but someone else)

Or

A sewer system that leads outside of the building where the escape rooms are located.
